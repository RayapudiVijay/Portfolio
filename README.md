# APPROACH
Portfolio Website
ðŸ“„ Description
This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements in a clean, modern, and responsive layout. The site serves as a professional online presence and a hub for contact and social links.

ðŸ’¡ Approach
Design & Layout

Designed a clean, user-friendly UI with sections like About, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

Used responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.

Development

HTML was used to create the structure and semantic layout.

CSS styled the page with modern design techniques, animations, and transitions.

JavaScript added interactivity (like toggles, form validation, or scroll effects).

Profile Section & Socials

Added a profile image in the header for personal branding.

Included clickable social media icons (Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.) with hover effects.

Optimization

Ensured fast loading, clean code, and accessibility.

Made sure it's easy to update and extend as I build new skills or projects.
